        <h2>4. Design</h2>
        <p>The design of this project involves several key components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ride Request System:</strong> Users can request rides by specifying their current location and destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Driver Management:</strong> Drivers can register, manage their availability, and accept or reject ride requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Route Optimization:</strong> Algorithms calculate the most efficient routes for rides.</li>
            <li><strong>Fare Calculation:</strong> A system to calculate fares based on multiple dynamic factors.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time Tracking:</strong> Enables users to track their rides and communicate with drivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Trip History:</strong> Records details of all past rides for both users and drivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback System:</strong> Allows users to rate their rides and provide feedback.</li>
        </ul>
